# lets-play-word-games

## Description

I built this game in an attempt to learn to use count down timers. This challenge caused me quite a bit of trouble, and I'm not really sure why. My original code threw alot of errors, so I went to my brother for help, and when he took my code and put it in his computer it worked fine. This caused significant delays for me while I tried to overcome the issues.

## Credits
    Christopher Otten, Senior Software Engineer at Target Corp - My younger brother, collaborated with me to fix issues I was having in my code, he gave me some tips on alternative method and terminology, and is a major reason I was able to get this project completed.
